This project aims to develop an automated solution for evaluating OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheets using Python and OpenCV. The system takes a scanned or photographed OMR sheet and enhances it through grayscale conversion, blurring, and thresholding to improve contrast and clarity. It then identifies contours in the image and filters them to detect answer bubbles. These bubbles are sorted based on their layout to preserve the correct order of questions. For each set, the system selects the most filled bubble, compares it with a predefined answer key, and determines correctness. Correct and incorrect responses are visually highlighted, and the overall score is computed, offering an accurate and efficient method for grading OMR tests without the need for dedicated scanning equipment.
